## AI-Powered-Crop-Disease-Detection-System
AI-Powered Crop Disease Detection is an intelligent, cloud-enabled platform that leverages deep learning and computer vision to automatically identify crop diseases from leaf images. The system significantly reduces manual inspection efforts while enabling early, accurate, and scalable disease diagnosis for farmers and agricultural stakeholders.

## About
The AI-Powered Crop Disease Detection System is designed to address the critical challenge of early disease identification in agriculture. Traditional crop disease diagnosis relies heavily on manual observation by farmers or agricultural experts, which is time-consuming, subjective, and often inaccurate—especially in large-scale farming environments.

This system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on labeled plant leaf images to automatically detect and classify crop diseases. The platform accepts leaf images captured via mobile phones or cameras and processes them through a trained deep learning model to predict the disease type with high accuracy.

Unlike rule-based or purely manual methods, the proposed system provides automated, data-driven disease detection while maintaining transparency in predictions. The solution supports real-time inference, enabling timely intervention and reducing crop loss. It is designed as a scalable, user-friendly platform suitable for modern precision agriculture.
